# customitems
a pretty epic Minecraft plugin to create custom Hypixel-Skyblock themed items

Designed for the <a href="https://minefalls.xyz" target="_blank">MineFalls server</a>

## This plugin is not yet ready for public use and is a work in progress

warnings aside, this plugin really is epic tho

this plugin relies on lore, and NBT data to function. Once finished, it will be extremely easy to create your own custom powerful items. 
Currently, the items in this plugin are: 
 - Cocaine
 - An empty placeholder item class which you can use to create random shit that does nothing
 - Lightning rod

As of now, these are the only items, but they work properly (i think)

# commands
 - /customitem list
 - /customitem give {item name}


Also, thanks to ThirtyVirus. This plugin is heavily inspired by his UberItems plugin
